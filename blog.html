  <h2>Incremental Learning</h2>

  <p>
      If you've ever walked into the wrong class before you will know what it feels like to get absolutely nothing.
      But somehow the people in the class will understand it perfectly. The difference of course is that the students have
      the necessary background and you do not. Similar to how in <em> The Great Gatsby </em> Nick Caraway's father told him
      "just remeber that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages you had", previous exposure is an advantage.
      <br><br>
      A common trope expressed by students of science is that they know more about the world than Newton, but maitain that Newton
      was still smarter than them. Modern students have the advantage of having all this stuff figured out for them already.
      <br><br>
      The issue comes when you need to teach people with varying backgrounds. The same material can seem completely overwhelming
      to some, while trivial to others. I believe that when if a student has all the necessary background for a concept, the next
      step should be logical to them. If not, then that means that there is some background missing.
      <br><br>
      Resources like <a href = "www.khanacademy.org"><em>Khan Academy</em></a> are excellent for this. The extensive amount of content
      on <em>Khan Academy</em> mean that a learner can fill holes in their knowledge, and can expand upon what they know when they have
      a good base of knowledge. There are many things in the same vein, but what they have in common is they usually assume no prior knowledge
      of the subject and provide a base while still going spreading into the more advanced side of the topic, and particularly have a decent way
      for the student to measure their progress.
      <br><br>
      Learning is the process of increasing knowledge in many incremental steps. Self-learning is aided by the availability of information
      at each step.
