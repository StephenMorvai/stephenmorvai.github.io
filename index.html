	<p>I love to learn new things and challenge myself. I use khan academy, codecademy, and MIT opencouseware in addition to being an engineering student at Carleton University.</p>
	<p>I work at a martial arts studio part time, and along with teaching students, I handle all the computer systems used in the business.</p>
	<p>I am passionate about science and math, and I like to make programs related to those subjects. Examples include a gravity simulator, a poker hand statistics generator, a math based game for children, and a quantum physics based arcade game.</p>

	<a href = http://www.kongregate.com/games/StephenMorvai/quantum-leap><h3>Quantum Leap on Kongregate</h3></a>
	<p>
	Quantum Leap is a game where the player controls an electron on a hydrogen atom and gets  
	hit by photons which change the energy level of the electron. The player must try to avoid 
	getting knocked off the electron entirely. This project uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

	<a href = https://github.com/GoldenCookie/BlackBerryApp><h3>BlackBerry Playbook Educational App</h3></a>
	<p>
	A BlackBerry Playbook App developed with a partner based on criteria given by elementary school students. 
	The students could not decide on a single game so they gave us three mini games to develop. In the first 
	game the player helps a penguin jump to across the water by answering basic math problems. In the second 
	game the player guides an eagle through the air trying to avoid trees and other obstacles while chasing 
	mice and fish. In the last game the player helps a cat drop apples on a mouse and gets more apples by   
	answering math questions.
