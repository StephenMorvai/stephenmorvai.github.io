	<p>I love to learn new things and challenge myself. I use khan academy, codecademy, <br> and MIT opencouseware in addition to being an engineering student at Carleton University.</p>
	<p>I work at a martial arts studio part time, and along with teaching students, <br> I handle all the computer systems used in the business.</p>
	<p>I am passionate about science and math, and I like to make programs related to <br> those subjects. Examples include a gravity simulator, a poker hand statistics generator, <br> a math based game for children, and a quantum physics based arcade game.</p>

	<a href = http://www.kongregate.com/games/StephenMorvai/quantum-leap><h3>Quantum Leap on Kongregate</h3></a>
	<p>
	Quantum Leap is a game where the player controls an electron on a hydrogen atom and gets<br> 
	hit by photons which change the energy level of the electron. The player must try to avoid <br> 
	getting knocked off the electron entirely. This project uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

	<a href = https://github.com/GoldenCookie/BlackBerryApp><h3>BlackBerry Playbook Educational App</h3></a>
	<p>
	A BlackBerry Playbook App developed with a partner based on criteria given by elementary school students. <br>
	The students could not decide on a single game so they gave us three mini games to develop. In the first <br>
	game the player helps a penguin jump to across the water by answering basic math problems. In the second <br>
	game the player guides an eagle through the air trying to avoid trees and other obstacles while chasing <br>
	mice and fish. In the last game the player helps a cat drop apples on a mouse and gets more apples by  <br> 
	answering math questions.
