	<h1>Stephen Morvai</h1>
	
	<p>I love to learn new things and challenge myself. I use khan academy, codecademy, <br> and MIT opencouseware in addition to being an engineering student at Carleton University.</p>
	<p>I work at a martial arts studio part time, and along with teaching students, <br> I handle all the computer systems used in the business.</p>
	<p>I am passionate about science and math, and I like to make programs related to <br> those subjects. Examples include a gravity simulator, a poker hand statistics generator, <br> a math based game for children, and a quantum physics based arcade game.</p>
