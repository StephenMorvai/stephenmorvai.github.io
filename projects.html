	<a href = http://www.kongregate.com/games/StephenMorvai/matching-experiment><h3>Matching Experiment on Kongregate</h3></a>
	<p>
	A tile matching where you get to decide how many different different tiles there are, how big the playing area is, and how many tiles need to match.
	My eventual goal with this game is to implement statistics gathering to see which combinations provide the optimal difficulty.

	<a href = https://github.com/GoldenCookie/BlackBerryApp><h3>BlackBerry Playbook Educational App</h3></a>
	<p>
	A BlackBerry Playbook App developed with a partner based on criteria given by elementary school students.
	The students could not decide on a single game so they gave us three mini games to develop. In the first
	game the player helps a penguin jump to across the water by answering basic math problems. In the second
	game the player guides an eagle through the air trying to avoid trees and other obstacles while chasing
	mice and fish. In the last game the player helps a cat drop apples on a mouse and gets more apples by
	answering math questions.
